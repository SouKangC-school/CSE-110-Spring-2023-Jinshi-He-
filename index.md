# Introduction

My name Jinshi He, a second major **Computer Engineering** student who loves programming and watching live stream. I love one of the quote from Linus Trovolds, the inventor of the Linux operating system:

> "Most of the good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.”

This is the exact reason for me to pursue a career in computer science. I always believe that mind-blowing innovations or discoveries always come from people's decicated interest and efforts, which is what I am striving for during my study at UCSD.

# Miscellaneous
## Joke about c++
1. 
```
C++; // makes C bigger, returns old value
```
2. 
Two bytes meet. The first byte asks, “Are you ill?”
The second byte replies, “No, just feeling a bit off.”

3. 
Two strings walk into a bar.

The first one says: "I'll have a beer please."

The second one says: "I'll have a i4n oainfian enf%&8728&"*$_%+"nr8n R8"

The first one string then says: "Please excuse my friend, he's not null terminated!"
